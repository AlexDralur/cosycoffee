### **Marketing Strategy Implementation:**

#### *Branding:*
- Considering that coffee is a fruit and the thought of it reminds plantation, the base colours for the project were earth ones, with brown, black and white to geberate contract. For the font, Mulish was the one chosen: it is a clear, non-serif font, with sober identity that can provide easy ready.

#### *SEO:*
- The project was though in a way that any search engine could take advantage of any of the pages of the website. All of the texts in the website, specially the descriptions use keywords that would provide a better classification of the website for queries regading coffee roasters, coffee beans and any related searches.

#### *Keywords:*
- The head part of the website also contains the keywords relevate for the website. Keywords are living data. They can change: new ones can be added, others can be removed. So it is a study that needs to be done on a constantly basis. For this project, a search should be carried out every six months through plataforms like Google Ads to provide the best results.

#### *Newsletter:*
- As part of an objective of interacting with the clients of the website in the most engaging and personal way, a Newsletter subscription was created. That allows the users to opt-in for the emails where they can have access to the lastest offers and new products that are added to the website. It is a non-invasive marketing option, that only reaches out to people who are really interested in the company and/or products.

#### *Socialmedia:*
- Like the Newsletter, Social Media is a necessary point of contact for any company that wants not only to have clients but brandlovers. Brandlovers are especially important for situations for when crysis occur. They can be a way to prevent or to come back easily from a bad situtation, brandwise. Based on a BrandPersona study the best ones can be chosen. Since coffee has a lot to do with visual and feeling, Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok would be highly recommended.

### **Forum Structure:**
- There are three levels of access within the e-commerce. The first is the user who is not registered in the website. They can see the products, producers, search for products, the bag, have access to the footer and also access the page to login and signup. If the user is registered, they can have access to their profile page, with their previous orders and also the checkout page. The last level is superuser, the administrator of the website, who can add products and producers. They can also edit and delete on the products and producers page.
