## **Overview**

Cosycoffee is coffee roaster with an e-commerce website aimed to coffee lovers. On the website, the users can find several options of speciality coffee beans roasted by the company to buy and also accessories like filters, different brewing methods and others. Once they are logged in and they make their first purchase, their shipping details are attached to their profile, so they do not need to repeat that step on a second order. They also have the chance to sign up for the newsletter.

#### *Secure checkout:*

- When the user decides to make the payment, they are taken to the page where they can add their shipping/billing information.

This is a marketing decision, so that every sell can bring a new lead for the list of users and for the newsletter. Once the payment is finalised, they are informed that the order was made and that they will received an email with the confirmation soon.
